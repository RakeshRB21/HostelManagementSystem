This Hotel Management tool is designed to efficiently handle various hotel operations such as storing customer details, booking rooms across four different types, ordering food for specific rooms, unbooking rooms, and generating bills. Additionally, the tool allows users to view room features and check room availability. The program is menu-driven and remains active until the user decides to exit.

To ensure that no data is lost when the program closes, file handling is implemented to save the current state of the hotel, including customer details, booked rooms, and food orders. When the program restarts, it reads from the file to restore the previous status, allowing operations to continue seamlessly.

File writing is managed in a separate thread to run concurrently with other processes, enhancing the program's efficiency. A user-defined exception is included to prevent users from booking a room that is already occupied, ensuring smooth operation and a better user experience. Comprehensive exception handling is also implemented to manage any unexpected errors that might occur.

Key topics covered in this tool include Classes and Objects, Inheritance, File Handling with Objects, ArrayLists, Interface Implementation, User-Defined Exceptions, and Exception Handling.
